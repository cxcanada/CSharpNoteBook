    public static class Car(){

    }
```

- abstract keyword    
```c#
public abstract class Enum : ValueType, IComparable, IConvertible, IFormattable
```
The abstract modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the abstract modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.

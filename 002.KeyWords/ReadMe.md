# Key Words
> Key words docs click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/)

Key words are predefined, reserved identifiers that have special meaning to the compiler. They cannot be used as identifiers in you program.

## Keywords and Contextual keywords

Contextual keywords have special meaning only in a limited program context and can be used as identifiers outside that context. Generally, as new keywords are added to the C# language, they are added as contextual keywords in order to avoid breaking programs written in earlier versions.
